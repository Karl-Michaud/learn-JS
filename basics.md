# Basics of JavaScript

As of now, we will be learning JS in the IDE which means that it is not client side. Why is that something we need to know?
Well simply put: 

JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for client-side web development, while Node is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side.
We are currently using Node.js to run the helloworld.js program.

In other words, NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment. Javascript is a computer programming language that is used to build scripts for websites. With the support of NodeJS, Javascript can be executed outside of the browser.

Finally, one last thing. In JavaScript, the semicolon is not required, but it is good practice to use it.
With that in mind, we can proceed!

# Standard output and comments

1) In-line comment using //
2) Multi-line comment using /* ... */
3) Standard ouput using `console.log("this is am example")`


# Data Types and Variables

Like any other Object-Oriented language, Javascript has types primitive and reference types.

1) undefined: something that has not been yet defined. Like a variable that hasn't been set yet
2) null: nothing
3) boolean
4) string: immutable type
5) symbol: immutable primitive value that is unique
6) number: like the name suggest it is a number (int or float/double)
7) Object: can store key-value pairs
